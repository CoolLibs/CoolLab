# CoolLab

A place to experiment with [Cool](https://coollibs.github.io/) and develop it. 

Check out [this section](https://coollibs.github.io/cool/building) of our website to learn how to clone, build, and more!

Also check out [CoolLab's main page](https://coollibs.github.io/lab).

## Running the tests

Simply use "tests/CMakeLists.txt" to generate a project, then run it.<br/>
If you are using VSCode and the CMake extension, this project already contains a *.vscode/settings.json* that will use the right CMakeLists.txt automatically.
