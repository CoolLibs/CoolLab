## How to add a variable

Add in the "code_generator.py" script, and run it.
Add in string_to_type function used to parse parameters in the shader (or can this function also be generated by the script?)

TODO: in the shader we can `#define Color vec3` so that the shader compiles just fine and when we parse we can distinguish color from vec3.
