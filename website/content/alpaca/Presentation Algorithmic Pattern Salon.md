Coollab is a node-based generative-art software where you compose small building blocks to create great artworks. It shares a few similarities with TouchDesigner, NotchVFX and the likes. But unlike any software that we are aware of, Coollab takes a much higher-level approach, inspired by functional programming. The main design guideline of Coollab is to have a very low barrier to entry, to be very intuitive even to people with little to no knowledge in programming or mathematics. While at the same time making it very easy for people who know shader programming to add their own effects and nodes to the software.

## On the user side

[Comparaison uv distortion entre Blender et Coollab, l'ordre n'est pas le même, + intuitif / déclaratif dans Coollab]

[Show fractal noise and the higher-order function approach: passing a noise function to the fractal noise node + this allows creative uses: people passing photos in there and having a nice repetition effect]

## Behind the curtain

[Montrer l'implem de qques nodes, à quel point c'est simple et on se concentre sur le code de l'effet, 0 boilerplate, le logiciel gère les conversions etc.]
